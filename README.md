# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Crunch Time is a smart phone app that helps the user calculate the amount of calories he/she burns for a certain amount of exercise; it can also find the amount of another exercise that the user needs to do in order to burn the same amount of calorie. In the app, there is a text field for the user to enter the amount of exercise. After selecting the type of the exercise and clicking a button (“Calculate!”), the app will display the amount of calories the exercise will burn. Then, the user can select the type of other exercise and click the calculate button to find out the amount of another exercise that will burn the same amount of calories
